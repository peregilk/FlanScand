There were 4,394 cases in which planes came too close to one another in the year ending September 1, 2012 -- up from 1,895 the year before, the Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday. Forty-one events were characterized as \"high-risk events.\" None resulted in accidents. The FAA had predicted an increase as it phased in a program to monitor radar and automatically report problems. The agency says it is a victim of its own success. With commercial aircraft accidents  rare -- or non-existent in some recent years -- it is difficult to use accident data to identify trends. So the FAA has placed a greater emphasis on looking at \"precursors\" to accidents, such as \"loss of separation\" events in which aircraft come closer together than intended. \"We are covering electronically and identifying things that we never did before,\" said one FAA official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 4,394 \"losses of separation\" in 2012 occurred during 132 million take-offs and landings. Put another way, that's 3.3 incidents per 100,000 operations, the FAA said. \"If you want a measure of safety, that's the number,\" the official said. FAA has various separation standards, depending on air space and aircraft. At high altitudes, planes should be separated by at least five miles horizontally or 1,000 feet vertically. Nearer to airports, planes can be closer together. The agency said it has worked with its workforce and the controllers' union to change the safety culture of the agency -- emphasizing collection of data over punishment. Under the new non-punitive reporting system, controllers are encouraged to voluntarily report mistakes and problems. It has buttressed that with an automated system that monitors air traffic, reporting problems to headquarters without any influence from the local facility. As a result of five different reporting systems, the number of reports grew 10-fold in 2012. Officials said the new system makes comparisons with previous years misleading. Information collected in 2012 and 2013 will create a new baseline for meaningful comparisons in the future. Of the 4,394 \"loss of separation\" incidents, the FAA said 1,271 involved cases where the planes came 34 percent closer than allowed. Of those, it characterized 1,048 as \"low risk\" events, 182 as \"medium risk,\" and 41 as \"high risk.\"","task":"cnn_dailymail_10templates","index":145867,"inputs_nor":"FAA sier \u00e5rs-over-\u00e5r-\u00f8kning p\u00e5 grunn av bedre rapportering.

A party at a gaming conference featuring women wearing skimpy clothes while dancing on stage has caused several high profile female industry figures to speak out about what they say is the unacceptable level of sexism that still persists within their field of work. The Game Developers Conference is a four-day event, held in San Francisco, which is the largest annual gathering of professional video game developers. It finished on Friday and the issue dominating much of the event was that women working in the industry have had enough of being demeaned and objectified by their male counterparts. Brenda Romero, disgusted by the dancing. girls at an event co-organized by the International Game Developer\u2019s. Association, promptly resigned her position as co-chair of it's Women in. Games group via Twitter. Taking a stand: Meagan Marie, left, and Brenda Romero, right, have both spoken out this week about the overt sexism that still exists within the gaming industry. Dancing girls: Women in skimpy clothing are apparently still acceptable at gaming industry events in 2013. 'Two women walked up to me this morning with tears in their eyes and thanked me,' Romero wrote in a follow-up tweet. 'Now I have tears in my eyes.' The IGDA, a non-profit organization, has acknowledged that some of the performers' outfits were inappropriate, reports Business Insider. 'We regret that the IGDA was involved in this situation,' read an IGDA statement. 'We do not condone activities that objectify or demean women or any other group of people.' She wasn\u2019t the only woman determined to take a stand against sexism within the industry. On Tuesday, Meagan Marie, who works for Crystal Dynamics who make games including Tomb Raider, also took a public stand against the sexism she had had to endure at PAX, a gamers conference the previous week. Gender equality has become a hot-button issue in Silicon Valley, especially on the heels of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's 'Lean In' Marie is known for organizing 'cosplay' events where gamers dress up in costumes. Many video games depict women in revealing clothes and so some of the costumes were sexy. Unfortunately, blogged Marie, some men think that gives them the right to be vulgar or aggressive. 'The situation this weekend at PAX made. me question why I'm willing to stand up for others, but not myself. By. allowing myself to be treated this way I'm perpetuating that this. behavior is acceptable. 'And it isn't. If I continue stand by silently, I. might as well sit on the sidelines and watch while other young women. endure what I have.

Richards attended the popular SXSW conference in Austin, TX earlier this month. 'I want to feel safe and valued as a member of. this industry, whether I'm conducting an interview, talking to fans on a. convention floor, or cosplaying. And I have a right to that,' she wrote. The issue of sexism remains an issue throughout Silicon Valley.

{"inputs":"Linda Kelsey says\u00a0that  far from over-50s reconciling themselves to becoming invisible, this is when women take greater pride in their appearance. The air was heady as hundreds of women, ranging in age from 35 to 70 (and counting), wafted fragrantly into the room. But even more arresting was the fact that, without exception, it was those over 50 who\u2019d really pulled out all the stops at the charity event I was speaking at. Each one was not just expensively perfumed, but expertly made-up and dressed to the nines. While some of the younger ones looked rather like they\u2019d just fallen out of bed, or rushed the kids to school without brushing their hair, the loos were crowded with women of a certain age re-applying their lippy and checking for VPL in the mirror. You might, if you wished to be unkind, call this an exercise in mass vanity. And in many ways, I would be inclined to agree \u2014 only I refuse to accept being called vain as a criticism, and claim it as a compliment instead. Contrary to the notion that once past a certain age it\u2019s hardly worth bothering, because men stop noticing you anyway, I find it immensely cheering that, far from over-50s reconciling themselves to becoming invisible, this is when women take an even greater pride in their appearance. A pride which only increases as the years go by. That\u2019s not to say that I cared any less about my appearance in my 30s than I do now, although I certainly devoted less time to it. Going fresh-faced and natural may have given the illusion of modesty, but it was simply a viable option. Now in my 60s, the no make-up look equals drained and decrepit, rather than carefree, so no wonder it takes me a good half hour longer to leave the house. I sometimes even put on make-up when I\u2019m not planning to go out at all, in order not to depress myself when I pass the mirror in my bathroom. Whereas once I could wash and go in 20 minutes flat, my hair has now thinned and needs washing and painstakingly blow- drying every second day. And to fill in the ever-widening parting, I have to sprinkle on Viviscal, tiny hair fibres that fill the gaps and make it look thicker. These days I don\u2019t even go out to walk the dog without a slick of lipstick and a quick brush of the mascara wand. Vain as that may seem, I am not alone. Although I knew few of the women at my table at this charity brunch, I soon found myself engaged in banter about our lives and our families. One, well into her 60s, giggled as she told me that her 38-year-old daughter was finally getting married. These days Linda doesn't even go out to walk the dog without a slick of lipstick and a quick brush of the mascara wand. Vain as that may seem, she says she is not alone as other middle aged women feel similarly. \u2018I told her a decade ago that she needed to hurry up because I wanted to wear a sleeveless dress at her wedding! But it\u2019s taken her a whole ten years, and now I\u2019m going to have to wear sleeves!\u2019 Vanity, certainly, but not without self-knowledge and a sense of humour. Another sexagenarian, a breast cancer survivor with a penchant for short skirts and leopard-print ankle boots, described herself to me as \u2018wayward\u2019. \u2018I like to look a bit different,\u2019 she said. Having lost her confidence while going through chemotherapy, when her hair grew back she ditched the blonde dye she\u2019d previously used to disguise her greys, and reverted to the auburn of her youth that speaks not of narcissism, but of renewed vitality. The town Vanity in Pilgrim\u2019s Progress held a perpetual fair, trading in frivolous goods. As for me, who spends all day communing with my computer and doesn\u2019t exactly need to buy myself smart daywear, I confess the minute I accepted the charity\u2019s invitation to speak \u2014 and before I\u2019d even given a moment\u2019s thought to what I was going to say \u2014 my attention turned first to what I was going to wear. Only when I had splashed out on a dress, nude tights and a pair of heels that looked the biz, and hurt like hell, did I get down to writing my speech. Vain? Yes, but I\u2019m in no doubt that feeling and looking good only aided my delivery. Why should vanity become a dirty word, when we women are praised from childhood for prettiness, and complimented on how we look? When I was little, whenever we went away on holiday, my ever-glamorous mother would clutch her vanity case to her bosom as though it housed the crown jewels. To me, it had an aura of magic: turning the tiny golden key and flipping the mirrored leather lid, I would marvel at the array of lotions and potions that make up a woman\u2019s beauty armoury, corralled in their hand-stitched compartments. No wonder the word vanity came to have positive connotations for me. As teenagers, my girlfriends and I would spend far too long peering into mirrors, trying on clothes we couldn\u2019t afford, encouraging each other to experiment with make-up. It was a means of bonding, a collective vanity that, ironically, paved the way to a collective sisterhood that still holds firm. There may be much to be said for the Mary Beard approach to life, whereby the sheer force of your confidence, intellect and charisma allows you to cast aside the trivial pursuits of fashion, cosmetics and regular haircuts. But what\u2019s wrong with having surfaces, as well as depths? Why shouldn\u2019t women break through the glass ceiling in Mac lipstick and Estee Lauder mascara? When The Apprentice star Karren Brady took ermine recently in the House of Lords, she was mocked by this paper\u2019s own sketch writer for the height of her heels, the quantities of slap she wore and her highlighted hair: \u2018groomed as though for Crufts\u2019. Well, I wanted to yell bravo, because in my eyes her glamour only enhanced, rather than diminished, her success. I felt the same, a fortnight ago, when Helen Mirren, 69, become the new face of L\u2019Oreal. Though I wish she weren\u2019t the only older woman being wheeled out as proof that our generation can cut it in the beauty stakes, her appointment only affirmed my belief that, however time has withered me, rather than giving up on my looks, they\u2019re still worth taking care of. Hold on to your vanity with hoops of steel I say. I\u2019m not talking about an artificial attempt to hold back the years \u2014 to convince the world you\u2019re 40 when you\u2019re 50, or to succumb to the surgeon\u2019s knife \u2014 but a commitment to making the most of yourself, and looking and feeling the very best of your age.\nWhat are the important parts of this article?","targets":"Linda Kelsey says over-50s shouldn't resign themselves to being invisible.\nThis is when women take greater pride in their appearance.\nShe won't even go out to walk the dog without a slick of lipstick.\nVain as that may seem, she says she is not alone.","task":"cnn_dailymail_10templates","index":145871,"inputs_nor":"Linda Kelsey sier at langt fra over-50er som forsoner seg med \u00e5 bli usynlige, er det n\u00e5r kvinner er mer stolte av utseendet sitt. Luften var p\u00e5 mote som hundrevis av kvinner, i alderen 35 til 70 \u00e5r (og telling), og den kom velluktende inn i rommet. Men enda mer p\u00e5trengende var det at det uten unntak var de over 50 som virkelig hadde kommet til alle de stoppene p\u00e5 det veldedighetsarrangementet jeg snakket om. Hver av dem var ikke bare dyre parfymert, men kyndig sminket og kledd til nierne. Mens noen av de yngre s\u00e5 ut som om de bare hadde falt ut av sengen, eller l\u00f8p barna p\u00e5 skolen uten \u00e5 pusse h\u00e5ret, var loene overfylt med kvinner i en viss alder som p\u00e5 nytt tok p\u00e5 seg leppepoma og sjekket for VPL i speilet. Hvis du \u00f8nsker \u00e5 v\u00e6re uvennlig, kan du kanskje kalle dette en \u00f8velse i masseforfengelighet. Og p\u00e5 mange m\u00e5ter ville jeg v\u00e6re enig \u2014 bare jeg nekter \u00e5 godta \u00e5 bli kalt forgjeves som en kritikk, og hevder at det er en kompliment i stedet. Stikk i strid med den oppfatning at en gang ved en viss alder er det neppe verdt \u00e5 bry seg, fordi menn slutter \u00e5 legge merke til deg likevel, synes jeg det er enormt oppmuntrende \u00e5 h\u00f8re at, langt fra over-50 som forsoner seg med \u00e5 bli usynlig, er dette n\u00e5r kvinner tar en enda st\u00f8rre stolthet over sitt utseende. En stolthet som bare \u00f8ker etter hvert som \u00e5rene g\u00e5r. Det betyr ikke at jeg brydde meg mindre om hvordan jeg var i 30 - \u00e5rene, enn jeg gj\u00f8r n\u00e5, selv om jeg helt sikkert brukte mindre tid p\u00e5 det. \u00c5 g\u00e5 nyanansikt og natur kan ha gitt en illusjon av beskjedenhet, men det var rett og slett et levedyktig alternativ. I mine 60 \u00e5r er ikke sminke-utseendet t\u00f8rr og vankel, snarere enn sorgl\u00f8s, s\u00e5 ikke rart at det tar meg en halv time lenger \u00e5 forlate huset. Noen ganger tar jeg til og med p\u00e5 meg sminke n\u00e5r jeg ikke har tenkt \u00e5 g\u00e5 ut i det hele tatt, for ikke \u00e5 bli deprimert n\u00e5r jeg passerer speilet p\u00e5 badet. N\u00e5r jeg f\u00f8rst kunne vaske og g\u00e5 inn 20 minutter flat, h\u00e5ret mitt har n\u00e5 blitt tynnere og trenger vask og omhyggelig bl\u00e5se-t\u00f8rk annenhver dag. Og for \u00e5 fylle ut den stadig st\u00f8rre avskjeden, m\u00e5 jeg str\u00f8 p\u00e5 Viviscal, sm\u00e5 h\u00e5rfibre som fyller tomrommet og f\u00e5r det til \u00e5 se litt fortreffelig ut. N\u00e5 for tiden g\u00e5r jeg ikke ut en gang for \u00e5 g\u00e5 tur med hunden uten \u00e5 ha en leppestift og en rask pensel med mascara - staven. Jeg er ikke alene, selv om det kan se ut som om jeg er tom. Selv om jeg ikke hadde s\u00e5 mange av kvinnene ved bordet mitt p\u00e5 denne veldedighetsbrunsjen, ble jeg snart opptatt med \u00e5 sette meg inn i \u00e5 sette meg inn i hvordan livet v\u00e5rt og familiene v\u00e5re er. En, godt i 60-\u00e5rene, giggled som hun fortalte meg at hennes 38-\u00e5rige datter endelig skulle gifte seg. I dag g\u00e5r ikke Linda ut for \u00e5 g\u00e5 tur med hunden uten en leppestift og en rask pensel av mascara-staven. Hun sier at hun ikke er alene, selv om det kan virke som om hun er svak, slik andre middelaldrende kvinner f\u00f8ler det p\u00e5 samme m\u00e5te. \u00abJeg fortalte henne for ti \u00e5r siden at hun trengte \u00e5 skynde seg fordi jeg ville ha p\u00e5 meg en ermel\u00f8s kjole i bryllupet hennes! Men det har tatt henne hele ti \u00e5r, og n\u00e5 skal jeg m\u00e5tte b\u00e6re ermer!\u00bb Vanvitt, sannelig, men ikke uten selvviten og sans for humor. En annen sexmagenar, en brystkreft-overlevende med en hang etter korte skj\u00f8rt og fotst\u00f8vler med leopard-avtrykk, beskrev seg selv for meg som \u00abforover\u00bb. \u00abJeg liker \u00e5 se litt annerledes ut\u00bb, sa hun. Etter \u00e5 ha mistet selvtilliten mens hun gikk gjennom kjemoterapi, da h\u00e5ret hennes vokste tilbake, forlot hun det blonde fargestoffet som hun tidligere hadde brukt til \u00e5 forkle gr\u00e5tt, og gikk tilbake til sin ungdoms auburn som ikke snakker om narsissisme, men om fornyet livskraft. Byen Vanity i Pilgrim\u2019s Progress holdt en varehandel med l\u00f8ssluppen gods. N\u00e5r det gjelder meg, som bruker hele dagen til \u00e5 snakke med datamaskinen min og ikke helt trenger \u00e5 kj\u00f8pe meg selv et snobbete dagsang, innr\u00f8mmer jeg det minutt jeg tok imot den veldedige organisasjonens innbydelse til \u00e5 tale \u2014 og f\u00f8r jeg til og med hadde tenkt et \u00f8yeblikk p\u00e5 hva jeg skulle si \u2014 vendte min oppmerksomhet f\u00f8rst mot det jeg skulle ha p\u00e5 meg. F\u00f8rst da jeg hadde plasket ut p\u00e5 en kjole, nakentr\u00f8yer og et par h\u00e6ler som s\u00e5 ut som en business, og skadet som faen, kom jeg i gang med \u00e5 skrive talen min. Blein? Ja, men jeg er ikke i tvil om at den f\u00f8lelsen og det \u00e5 se godt ut var til hjelp for meg. Hvorfor skulle forfengelighet bli et skittent ord, n\u00e5r vi kvinner fra barndommen blir rost for skj\u00f8nnhet og roser oss for v\u00e5rt utseende? Da jeg var liten, n\u00e5r vi dro p\u00e5 ferie, pleide min fortryllende mor \u00e5 ta hennes forfengelighetssaker til sitt bryst som om det huset kronjuvlene. For meg hadde den en aura av magi: Vende den lille gulln\u00f8kkelen og snu det speilvendte skinnlokket, ville jeg undre meg over den rekken av lotioner og trylledrikker som utgj\u00f8r en kvinnes skj\u00f8nnhetsrustning, som er innhyllet i deres h\u00e5ndstukkede rom. Det er ikke rart at ordet forfengelighet fikk positive konnotasjoner for meg. Som ten\u00e5ringer pleide venninnene mine og jeg \u00e5 bruke altfor mye tid p\u00e5 \u00e5 kikke i speil, pr\u00f8ve kl\u00e6r vi ikke hadde r\u00e5d til, og oppmuntre hverandre til \u00e5 eksperimentere med sminke. Det var et middel til \u00e5 knytte b\u00e5nd, en kollektiv forfengelighet som ironisk nok banet veien for et kollektivt s\u00f8sterskap som fortsatt holder stand. Det kan v\u00e6re mye som kan sies om den m\u00e5ten du lever p\u00e5, og som gj\u00f8r det klart for deg at din tillit, din intelligens og din karisma gj\u00f8r det mulig for deg \u00e5 skyve de uvesentlige gj\u00f8rem\u00e5lene av mote, kosmetikk og regelmessige frisyrer til side. Men hva er galt med \u00e5 ha overflater og dybder? Hvorfor skulle ikke kvinner bryte seg gjennom glasstaket i maskaraen MacCelbec og Estee Lauder? Da Apprentice-stjernen Karren Brady tok ermine nylig i Overhuset, ble hun spottet av denne avisens egen tegner for h\u00f8yden av hennes h\u00e6ler, mengdene med klaps hun hadde p\u00e5 seg og hennes avkledde h\u00e5r: \u00abprydet som om det var for Crufts\u00bb. Jeg ville rope bravo, for i mine \u00f8yne var hennes yndighet bare forsterket, i stedet for redusert, hennes suksess. Jeg f\u00f8lte det samme, for lenge siden, da Helen Mirren, 69 \u00e5r, ble det nye ansiktet til L\u2019Oreal. Selv om jeg skulle \u00f8nske at hun ikke var den eneste eldre kvinne som ble lurt som et bevis p\u00e5 at v\u00e5r generasjon kan skj\u00e6re det p\u00e5 skj\u00f8nnhetsstakerne, var det bare hennes utnevnelse som bekreftet min tro p\u00e5 at uansett hvor gammel jeg er, s\u00e5 er de fortsatt verd \u00e5 ta seg av, i stedet for \u00e5 gi avkall p\u00e5 utseendet mitt. Hold fast ved din forakt p\u00e5 hover av st\u00e5l, sier jeg. Jeg snakker ikke om et fors\u00f8k p\u00e5 \u00e5 holde \u00e5rene tilbake \u2014 \u00e5 overbevise verden om at du er 40 n\u00e5r du er 50, eller om \u00e5 gi etter for kirurgens kniv \u2014 men om \u00e5 gj\u00f8re det beste ut av deg selv, og \u00e5 se og f\u00f8le det aller beste p\u00e5 din alder. Hva er de viktigste delene av denne artikkelen?","inputs_backtranslation":"Linda Kelsey says that far from over 50s who make their peace with being invisible, it's when women are more proud of their looks. The air was fashionable as hundreds of women, ages 35 to 70 (and counting), and it entered the room with perfume. But even more urgent was the fact that the more than 50 people had truly come to all the stops at the charity event I was talking about. Each was not only expensively perfumed but skilled in makeup and dressed for the nines. While some of the younger ones looked as if they had just fallen out of bed or ran to school without brushing their hair, the loons were crowded with women of a certain age who again put on lip boma and checked for VPL in the mirror. If you want to be unkind, you might call this an exercise in mass vanity. And in many ways, I would agree \u2014 as long as I refuse to be called in vain as a critic, claiming that it is a compliment instead. Contrary to the belief that once at a certain age it is hardly worth caring, because men cease to notice you anyway, I find it immensely encouraging to hear that, far from over 50 people who make up their minds to become invisible, this is when women take even greater pride in their appearance. A pride that only increases as the years go by. This does not mean that I cared less about what I was like in my 30 \u2019 s than I do now, although I surely spent less time on it. Walking with new faces and nature may have given the illusion of modesty, but it was simply a viable alternative. In my 60 years, the make-up look is not dry and vagrant, rather than carefree, so no wonder it takes me half an hour longer to leave the house. Sometimes I even wear makeup when I am not going out at all, not to get depressed when I pass the mirror in the bathroom. When I could first wash and enter 20 minutes flat, my hair has now become thinner and needs washing and carefully blowing-dry every other day. And in order to fill out the ever larger parting, I have to sprinkle on Viviscal, tiny hair fibers that fill the void and make it look a little bit wonderful. Nowadays, I don\u2019t even go out to walk the dog without a lipstick and a quick brush with the mascara staff. I'm not alone, even if it looks like I'm empty. Although I did not have so many of the women at my table on this charity brunch, I soon became absorbed in learning what our lives and families are like. One, well in her 60s, giggled like she told me her 38-year-old daughter was finally getting married. Today Linda doesn't go out to walk the dog without a lipstick and a quick brush of the mascara staff. She says that she is not alone, even though she may seem weak, as other middle - aged women feel. \"I told her ten years ago that she needed to hurry because I wanted to wear a sleeveless dress to her wedding! But it has taken her ten years, and now I shall wear sleeves' But not without knowledge and a sense of humor. Another sex motenar, a breast cancer survivor with one hanging from short skirts and leopard-printed foot boots, described himself to me as \u2018forward\u2019. \"I like to look a little different,\" she said. Having lost self - confidence as she went through chemotherapy, as her hair grew back, she left the blonde dye she had previously used to disguise gray and returned to her youth\u2019s auburn that speaks, not of narcissism, but of renewed vitality. Vanity of Pilgrim\u2019s Progress held a trade in loose goods. As for me, who spends all day talking to my computer and does not need to buy myself a snobby day song, I admit the minute I accepted the charitable organization\u2019s invitation to speak \u2014 and before I even thought for a moment what to say \u2014 my attention first turned to what to wear. Only after splashing out on a dress, naked shirts, and a pair of heels that looked like a business, and hurt like hell, did I start writing my speech. Blein? Yes, but I have no doubt that that feeling and looking good helped me. Why should vanity become a dirty word when we women from childhood are praised for beauty and boast about our appearance? When I was a kid, when we went on vacation, my enchanting mother used to take her vanity stuff to her breast like that house the crown thieves. For me, it had an aura of magic: Turn the little gold key and turn the mirrored leather cover, and I would marvel at the series of lotions and potions that make up a woman\u2019s beauty armor, enveloped in their hand - held rooms. No wonder the word vanity was given positive connotations for me. As teenagers, my girlfriends and I used to spend too much time looking in mirrors, trying out clothes we could not afford, and encouraging each other to experiment with makeup. It was a means of bonding, a collective vanity that ironically paved the way for a collective sisterhood that still stands firm. That's what I'm talking about. But what is wrong with having surfaces and depth? Why shouldn't women break through the glass ceiling of MacCelbec and Estee Lauder? When Apprentice star Karren Brady recently took her ermine in the House of Lords, she was ridiculed by this newspaper's own sketch artist for the height of her heels, the amount of slaps she wore and her stripped-off hair: \"The ploughed as if it were for Crupts.\" I wanted to shout bravo, for in my eyes her charm was only heightened, rather than diminished, her success. I felt the same way a long time ago when Helen Mirren, 69 years old, became the new face of L\u2019Oreal. Although I wish she were not the only older woman who was fooled as proof that our generation can cut it off on the beauty stakes, it was only her appointment that confirmed my belief that, no matter how old I am, they are still worth caring for instead of giving up my appearance. Hold on to your contempt on hooves of steel, I say. I\u2019m not talking about trying to hold back the years \u2014 convincing the world that you\u2019re 40 when you\u2019re 50 or giving in to the surgeon\u2019s knife \u2014 but about making the best of yourself and seeing and feeling the best of your age.
